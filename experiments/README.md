# Experiments

This folder contains Slurm launchers and compact result artifacts. Raw Slurm logs and JSONL runs stay under `experiments/runs/` and are not committed.

## Graphs

Verified WikiText and arithmetic plots are already committed:

Synthetic Code/Symbolic/Reasoning mix plots are pending until Reasoning mix finishes. Do not commit a partial graph as a final result.

## Main Result

| row | final loss | final PPL | readout |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| RLB MatrixPolicy-Muon | 3.476232 | 32.34 | best verified row |
| RLB Smooth-MatrixPolicy | 3.493210 | 32.89 | older smooth policy |
| SiLU/SwiGLU+AdamW beta2=0.999 | 3.549346 | 34.79 | strongest AdamW control |
| RLB+AdamW beta2=0.999 | 3.550018 | 34.81 | generic AdamW on RLB |
| RLB+AdamW | 3.617501 | 37.24 | untuned generic AdamW |
| SiLU/SwiGLU+AdamW | 3.621982 | 37.41 | original AdamW control |
| SiLU/SwiGLU+Muon | 3.644921 | 38.28 | generic Muon control |
| RLB+Muon | 3.657877 | 38.78 | generic Muon on RLB |

## Synthetic Fair Status

| task | best finished row so far | result | interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Code | SiLU/SwiGLU+AdamW | 0.088975 loss, 1.0931 PPL | saturated task; MatrixPolicy is worse at final loss. |
| Symbolic | SiLU/SwiGLU+Muon | 0.038782 loss, 1.0395 PPL | deltas are too small to claim a real win from one seed. |
| Reasoning mix | pending rerun | job 951127 | SiLU+AdamW complete, remaining rows still running. |

The completed synthetic tasks are near saturation, so tiny final-loss/PPL differences are not strong evidence. At loss `0.04-0.09`, a `0.001` loss difference barely moves PPL and can be seed/order noise. Treat Symbolic as diagnostic, not a win. Code is more useful as a negative diagnostic because MatrixPolicy is consistently behind there, but even that should not be overclaimed from one seed. The meaningful target remains a much larger same-LR gap, or a harder task where final loss is not already near zero.

Completed rows from Code and Symbolic are diagnostic, not final research claims. Reasoning mix is currently rerunning from scratch as job `951127` with `Requeue=1`.

## Summarize After Completion

```bash
.venv-cu128/bin/python experiments/scripts/summarize_synthetic_fair_full_20260529.py \
  --run-root experiments/runs/synthetic_fair_reasoning_mix_20260529
```

Then commit compact CSV/Markdown/PNG artifacts under `experiments/results/`, and update the README graph links.
